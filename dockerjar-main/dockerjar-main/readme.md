# About this project

This project is a simple demo web application using Java annotations. It
runs on Java 8 and requires an application server, such as
[Glassfish](https://glassfish.java.net), to run\*. The project, built using
[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/), will produce a deployable WAR file. It
outputs JSON using Google's [Gson](http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/)
library, which is imported and bundled at build time.
